# Nootube
Obsidian plugin for context-based video suggestions 

## Introduction

Nootube is an Obsidian plugin designed to enhance your YouTube experience by providing curated, meaningful video suggestions based on the content you’re already exploring. This tool aims to make consuming video content more guided and deliberate, ensuring your recommendations are directly tied to ideas you're already invested in. By finding new content in context, Nootube helps you expand on ideas in-place, making your video-watching experience more intentional and connected to your current interests and research.

## Purpose and Utility

The primary goal of Nootube is to give you better control over your YouTube recommendations and watching habits. Instead of being subjected to generic or trending suggestions, with the recommendations based on maximizing screen time, Nootube ensures that the videos you see are relevant to content you’re developing in Obsidian. This approach not only helps you stay focused but also encourages deeper exploration and understanding of the topics you care about, as opposed to mindless scrolling through endless suggestions.

## About the Name

The name "Nootube" is a nod to the noosphere, the sphere of human thought and collective consciousness. It represents a new way to engage with YouTube content. By aligning video recommendations with your intellectual pursuits, Nootube embodies this concept of a thoughtful and interconnected approach to learning.
